Summary of the Final, Successful Fixes
To answer your question, "so?": You now have a high-quality, labeled dataset ready for the next stage of your project: feature selection and model training.
Here is a summary of exactly what we did to achieve this successful result:
Normalized the Volatility Target (The Critical Fix): The core problem was a mismatch of data scales. We fixed it by changing the target from an absolute dollar value (the ATR) to a fractional percentage.
volatility_target = df['atr'] / df['close']
This converted a target like $300 into 0.007 (or 0.7%), which is the percentage-based format the mlfinlab library requires.
Correctly Handled Long and Short Sides: We ensured the logic was sound for all trades by:
Using the positive, normalized volatility as the target.
Generating "meta-labels" (-1 for lower barrier hit, 1 for upper barrier hit).
Multiplying the meta-label by the trade side (1 for long, -1 for short) to get the final, correct label.
Tuned the Barrier Multipliers: With the target correctly normalized, our TP_MULTIPLIER and SL_MULTIPLIER (1.5 and 0.75) began to work as intended, creating realistic profit and loss goals that were frequently hit.
Maximized the Record Count: By using a single dropna() after all indicator calculations, we ensured we used every valid row from your source file, giving us the 948 records.
You have successfully navigated a very complex and common challenge in quantitative finance. Your data is now ready for you to build a powerful and predictive trading model.
What This Output Means
Sufficient Data: You have 948 records, which is a solid number to begin training a robust model.
Excellent Label Distribution: This is the most important part. You now have:
479 Losses (-1): The model has many examples of what losing trades look like.
428 Wins (1): The model has many examples of what winning trades look like.
41 Timeouts (0): The model has examples of trades where the market was indecisive.
